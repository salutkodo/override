# üîê **CTF Challenge - Level-Based Exploitation**

This repository contains solutions for a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge where the goal is to obtain the password (`.pass`) for each level by exploiting various vulnerabilities.

In this project, you are presented with a series of levels on a virtual machine. Each level has a corresponding user (`levelXX`) and a hidden `.pass` file that contains the password for the next level. Your task is to exploit each level to gain access to the `.pass` file of the next user, progressively moving from `level00` to `level08`, and finally to `end`.

Each level presents a unique challenge designed to test your understanding of security concepts, exploitation techniques, and system vulnerabilities. By solving these challenges, you'll gain practical experience in areas like:

- Binary exploitation
- Memory management
- Privilege escalation
- Reverse engineering

The ultimate goal is to reach the `end` user by successfully navigating through all the levels and proving your skills in system exploitation.
